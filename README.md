# prompt_mixer

Script for https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui to let you mix two encoded prompts before generating an image.

This is still under development and might "work" but don't expect too much.

# Example

50/50 mix of "cat" and "dog". Seed: 1, Steps: 20, Sampler: Euler a, CFG: 7, 512x512
